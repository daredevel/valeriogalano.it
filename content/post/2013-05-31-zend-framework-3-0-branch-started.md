Yesterday, [Evan Coury][1], Zend Framework contibutor, announced [start of Zend Framework branch][2].

Development goals will be merged between ZF team ideas and community suggestions that will be collected in [this topic][3]. Anyway, Evan immediatly specifies that development will be focused on avoid dramatic migration as was for transition from ZF1 to ZF2.

For all developers that use Zend Framework for their projects, this is the best opportunity to take part to development process and be heard about their needs: power of Open Source.
