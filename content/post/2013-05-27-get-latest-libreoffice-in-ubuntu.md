[LibreOffice][1] is actually the most famous Open Source Office Suite. Unfortunately, Ubuntu repositories often doesn't contains latest versions of it.

If you like to have your LibreOffice always updated, you can simply execute following commands in your terminal:

{{< highlight bash >}}
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
{{< /highlight >}}

At the end of the process, simply run LibreOffice from applications menu and have fun.
