      <description>In recent days, I worked to convert my Wordpress-based personal website in a static blog created using Hugo framework. The result is the blog you are reading now.

But this is another story&amp;hellip;
Anyway, I discovered Hugo Framework at the suggestion of my friend Giuseppe Pugliese (Magnetarman) and, after some scouting on official documentation, I understood that it was what I was looking for.</description>
